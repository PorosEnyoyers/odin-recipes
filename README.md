My first website practicing HTML basics, building a website following The-Odin-Project courses.
The journey to get here was relatively easy, the only hard part was finding motivation to do the work out of work, wasted a lot of rest day without working on this project.
Expecting the later lesson difficulty spike since I'm aware of the honeymoon phase of coding.
Hopefully I will become more fluent with HTML after this small projects.

Spent 4 hr plus learnt CSS basics. It was productive, keep it going.
